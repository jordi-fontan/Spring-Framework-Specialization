**About this Course**
>In this course students will learn the why the Spring Framework is one of the dominant Java development Frameworks. the course covers a variety of techniques for Java  Object Dependency Injection using various forms of configuration data i.e. XML, Annotations and Java Configuration Classes with Factory Methods. Configurations will be enhanced with Expression Languages  and Conditional Beans that are  available  based off certain conditions like development environment i.e. test and production. Students will build an extensive application iteratively in a succession of hands on labs.

- Explain what Spring Framework is and why developers use it
- Understand the role of the major modules in Spring
- Explain the key concepts of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection
- Explain what Spring does for the programmer
- Explain the purpose of loose Coupling between beans
- Explain how the Spring Inversion of Control (IoC) Container Manages your Spring Beans
- Explain what is an ApplicationContext and how do we create one?
- Get a bean out of the Spring ApplicationContext and use it
- Configure the ApplicationContext with Bean Definitions
- Define Setter injection in an XML configuration file
- Define Constructor Injection in an XML configuration file
- Get a Spring Managed Bean and its object graph out of the Application Context

- Achieve Dependency Injection using Spring Annotations
- Use Spring Annotations to wire up dependencies in Spring Managed Beans
- Use javax JSR-250, and JSR330 Annotations to wire up dependencies in Spring Managed Beans
- Create Java @Configuration Classes
- Remove the dependency on XML configuration files completely
- Write JUnit Test classes that are part of the ApplicationContext
